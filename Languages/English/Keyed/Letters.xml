    <SMN_RelationshipRetaliation>Relations damaged</SMN_RelationshipRetaliation>
    <SMN_RelationshipRetaliationDesc>The attempted operation was intercepted and defeated by target defense measures. The faction suspects you of committing the attempt, but lacks hard evidence tying you to the crime. The actual impact on relations, {0}, seems to have occurred because the individual who intercepted it decided to take it upon themselves to accuse you in front of anyone willing to listen. An unfortunate diplomatic incident.</SMN_RelationshipRetaliationDesc>

    <SMN_FirstSurrogateCreated>About: Surrogates</SMN_FirstSurrogateCreated>
    <SMN_FirstSurrogateCreatedDesc>You have created your first surrogate pawn. Until it is connected to a controller (any SkyMind-connected pawn can toggle controls and link to this pawn), it will remain blank and not considered part of your faction. When connected to a controller, it will share the skills, passions, and relations with its controller. XP gained is automatically shared. Mood, health, and some other details can't be shared to avoid game-breaking issues.</SMN_FirstSurrogateCreatedDesc>

    <SMN_SurrogateSufferedMentalStateDesc>A surrogate has suffered a mental break and shut-down as a self-preservation reaction. It will reboot automatically.</SMN_SurrogateSufferedMentalStateDesc>

    <SMN_ControllerSufferedMentalState>Controller Breakdown</SMN_ControllerSufferedMentalState>
    <SMN_ControllerSufferedMentalStateDesc>A surrogate controller has suffered a mental break due to an extreme breakdown in a surrogate propagating to the controller or a breakdown in the controller directly. All connected surrogates to the controller have shut down - initiating reboots automatically - and have disconnected from the controller.</SMN_ControllerSufferedMentalStateDesc>
